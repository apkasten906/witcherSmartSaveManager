# Production Approval Gates

## Overview
The production environment requires approval before deployments can proceed. This ensures all production releases are reviewed and authorized.

## Approval Process

### 1. Automatic Triggers
Production deployments are triggered by:
- Pushes to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch (if configured)

### 2. Build and Test Phase
Before requiring approval, the workflow will:
- ✅ Build the application
- ✅ Run all unit tests
- ✅ Validate code quality
- ❌ **Stops here if any step fails**

### 3. Approval Gate
After successful build and test:
- 🛑 **Workflow pauses** and waits for approval
- 📧 **Notification sent** to required reviewers
- ⏰ **Wait timer** (if configured) provides additional safety delay
- 👥 **Required reviewers** must approve before proceeding

### 4. Release Phase (After Approval)
Once approved, the workflow will:
- 🏷️ Generate semantic version tag
- 📝 Create release notes from commits
- 🔨 Build Windows installer
- 🚀 Publish GitHub release with installer

## Required Reviewers

### Who Can Approve
- Repository owner (automatically)
- Users added to the production environment reviewers list
- Admin users (if configured)

### Approval Requirements
- **Minimum reviewers**: 1 (configurable)
- **Self-approval**: Allowed by default (can be disabled)
- **Dismiss stale reviews**: Optional setting

## Safety Features

### Pre-Approval Validation
- All tests must pass before approval is required
- Build must succeed completely
- Code quality checks complete

### Post-Approval Safety
- Wait timer provides buffer after approval
- Clear logging of who approved what
- Deployment can still be cancelled during wait period

### Audit Trail
- All approvals are logged in GitHub
- Deployment history tracked per environment
- Clear visibility of who deployed what when

## Notification Settings

### GitHub Notifications
- Email notifications to required reviewers
- In-app GitHub notifications
- Mobile notifications (if GitHub mobile app is used)

### Optional Integrations
- Slack notifications (can be added)
- Microsoft Teams integration
- Custom webhook notifications

## Emergency Procedures

### Bypassing Approval (Emergency Only)
If urgent deployment is needed:
1. Admin can temporarily remove approval requirement
2. Deploy with elevated permissions
3. Re-enable approval requirement after emergency
4. Document emergency deployment in audit log

### Rollback Procedures
If issues are discovered after deployment:
1. Approval required for rollback deployment
2. Previous release can be marked as latest
3. Hotfix branches can be used for urgent fixes

## Best Practices

### For Approvers
- ✅ Review the commit messages and changes
- ✅ Verify tests are passing
- ✅ Check release notes make sense
- ✅ Confirm timing is appropriate
- ❌ Don't approve unfamiliar changes without investigation

### For Developers
- 📝 Write clear commit messages for semantic versioning
- 🧪 Ensure all tests pass before merging to main
- 📋 Include context in PR descriptions
- ⏰ Plan deployment timing with team

### For Repository Maintainers
- 👥 Keep reviewer list up to date
- 🔧 Adjust approval requirements based on team needs
- 📊 Monitor deployment frequency and success rates
- 🔍 Review approval patterns for improvements
