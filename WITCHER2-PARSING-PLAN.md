# Witcher 2 Save File Parsing Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission: Smart Save Manager with Decision Impact Analysis

### Phase 1: Save File Structure Discovery

#### 1.1 Binary Analysis Setup
- [ ] Create `SaveFileAnalyzer` service in WitcherCore
- [ ] Implement binary file reader with structured parsing
- [ ] Add hex dump utilities for manual inspection
- [ ] Document save file header structure

#### 1.2 Quest Data Location
- [ ] Identify quest state storage format in .sav files
- [ ] Map quest IDs to human-readable names
- [ ] Locate quest phase/progress indicators
- [ ] Find decision variables and their values

#### 1.3 Test Data Collection
- [ ] Create multiple save files at key decision points:
  - Prologue choices (Aryan La Valette fate)
  - Chapter 1 path selection (Iorveth vs Roche)
  - Key moral decisions throughout
- [ ] Document exact differences between saves

### Phase 2: Core Parsing Engine

#### 2.1 Binary Parser Implementation
- [ ] `WitcherSaveFileParser` class for .sav file reading
- [ ] Quest data extraction methods
- [ ] Character variable parsing (reputation, relationships)
- [ ] Inventory state analysis (optional)

#### 2.2 Decision Impact Mapping
- [ ] Create decision taxonomy (moral, political, personal)
- [ ] Map quest states to narrative consequences
- [ ] Identify branching points and their outcomes
- [ ] Build decision impact database

#### 2.3 Smart Analysis Features
- [ ] Detect critical decision moments
- [ ] Analyze save file "quality" based on choices
- [ ] Predict narrative consequences
- [ ] Suggest optimal save points

### Phase 3: ML Foundation

#### 3.1 Data Structure for ML
- [ ] Feature extraction from quest states
- [ ] Decision vector representation
- [ ] Outcome classification schema
- [ ] Training data format definition

#### 3.2 Analysis Engine
- [ ] Smart save recommendation system
- [ ] Decision impact scoring
- [ ] Narrative path analysis
- [ ] Player behavior insights

### Phase 4: UI Integration

#### 4.1 Enhanced Save Display
- [ ] Current quest with context
- [ ] Recent decisions and their impact
- [ ] Critical choice indicators
- [ ] Narrative branch visualization

#### 4.2 Smart Features
- [ ] "Point of No Return" warnings
- [ ] Alternative path suggestions
- [ ] Decision consequence preview
- [ ] Save file "smartness" rating

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Implementation

### Core Classes Needed:
```csharp
// Save file parsing
public class WitcherSaveFileParser
public class QuestStateExtractor  
public class DecisionAnalyzer

// Smart analysis
public class NarrativePathAnalyzer
public class DecisionImpactCalculator
public class SaveFileIntelligence

// ML preparation
public class DecisionFeatureExtractor
public class OutcomePredictor
```

### Database Schema Extensions:
```sql
-- Decision tracking
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Decisions (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    SaveFileId INTEGER,
    DecisionId TEXT,
    DecisionType TEXT, -- moral, political, personal
    ChoiceMade TEXT,
    ImpactLevel INTEGER, -- 1-5 scale
    NarrativeConsequences TEXT
);

-- Quest branches
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS QuestBranches (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    QuestId TEXT,
    BranchPoint TEXT,
    Conditions TEXT,
    Outcomes TEXT
);
```

## ðŸŽ® Witcher 2 Specific Focus Areas

### Critical Decision Points to Track:
1. **Prologue**: Aryan La Valette's fate
2. **Chapter 1**: Iorveth vs Roche path choice
3. **Letho encounters**: Kill vs spare decisions
4. **Triss relationship**: Romance choices
5. **Political choices**: King's fate, political alliances

### Quest Impact Categories:
- **Immediate**: Affects current chapter
- **Long-term**: Changes available quests/characters
- **Ending**: Influences game conclusion
- **Moral**: Character development impact

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### What Makes Our Manager "Smart":
1. **Decision Awareness**: Knows what choices were made
2. **Impact Understanding**: Predicts consequences
3. **Optimal Timing**: Suggests when to save
4. **Alternative Paths**: Shows what could have been
5. **Player Insights**: Learns from decision patterns

This positions us as the **definitive smart save manager** for story-driven RPGs!
